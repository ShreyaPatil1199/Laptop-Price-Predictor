## About

Welcome to the Laptop Price Predictor project repository! This project showcases a Laptop price prediction system implemented through supervised machine learning techniques. The core of this research centres on the application of multiple linear regression as the chosen machine learning method, resulting in an impressive 82% prediction precision.

The foundation of this approach lies in the utilization of multiple independent variables to predict a single dependent variable. In this context, the dependent variable is the laptop's price, and its prediction is based on careful consideration of factors such as the laptop's model, RAM size, ROM type (HDD/SSD), GPU configuration, CPU specifications, IPS display presence, and Touch Screen availability.

The heart of this system lies in its ability to accurately predict laptop prices, providing valuable insights into the intricate relationships between various technical specifications and the ultimate cost. By employing a well-established machine learning technique like multiple linear regression, we enable users to make informed decisions about laptop purchases, leverage market trends, and understand the underlying dynamics affecting laptop pricing.

This project serves as a practical implementation of the research paper, offering a user-friendly interface for predicting laptop prices based on the provided specifications. It provides a valuable tool for tech enthusiasts, data scientists, and anyone interested in exploring the predictive power of machine learning in the realm of laptop pricing.

## Features

The Laptop Price Predictor project relies on a range of essential features to accurately predict laptop prices. Each feature contributes to the intricate web of factors that influence the cost of a laptop. Let's delve into each feature:

- **Company**: This categorical feature represents the laptop manufacturer. It includes renowned brands in the tech industry, influencing pricing based on brand reputation, quality, and market positioning.

- **TypeName**: The laptop's type or category is represented by this categorical feature. It categorizes laptops into various types, such as Notebooks, Ultrabooks, and Gaming laptops, influencing pricing based on the target audience and specific use cases.

- **Inches**: This numerical feature denotes the screen size of the laptop in inches. Larger screens may demand higher prices, often appealing to users seeking enhanced visual experiences.

- **ScreenResolution**: Representing the screen resolution of the laptop, this categorical feature provides insights into display quality. Higher resolutions may contribute to increased prices due to improved visual clarity and user experience.

- **Cpu**: The Central Processing Unit (CPU) of the laptop is captured by this categorical feature. It encompasses various processor types and specifications, with higher-performance CPUs typically resulting in higher laptop prices.

- **Ram**: This categorical feature denotes the Random Access Memory (RAM) capacity of the laptop. RAM size affects the laptop's multitasking capabilities and overall performance, influencing pricing accordingly.

- **Memory**: Representing the Hard Disk or Solid-State Drive (HDD/SSD) memory, this categorical feature contributes to the laptop's storage capacity. Larger storage capacities may lead to higher prices, accommodating user data and software requirements.

- **GPU**: The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is captured by this categorical feature. It encompasses different GPU configurations, including integrated and dedicated graphics, impacting the laptop's performance in graphics-intensive tasks and potentially affecting pricing.

- **OpSys**: This categorical feature represents the laptop's Operating System. Different operating systems can influence user preferences and software compatibility, thereby impacting the laptop's perceived value and pricing.

- **Weight**: The weight of the laptop is captured by this numerical feature. Lighter laptops may be more desirable for portability, potentially influencing pricing based on user preferences.

- **Price_euros**: This is the target variable of the prediction model. Representing the laptop's price in Euros, this numerical feature is what the prediction model aims to accurately predict based on the other features.
